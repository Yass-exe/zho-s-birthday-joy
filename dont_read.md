celebrate zho birthday 
even tho you left me 
may this be the proof of my love for u  
if you're seeing this i would be gone (idk if id be dead or having the best life but yea ) 
i kept every promise we made but idk for how much ill keep the one where i promised u to love u forever but 
idk girl u ruined me and this is a silent cry , tears of sadness and a gut wrenching feeling thats crushing me daily whenever i remember u and how much u melted that untrust glacier i built and convinced me that love exists 
u told me that im the best , im ur love and the one thats irreplaceable , all im seeing now is crushing lone nights and me standing with broken promises and everytime i remember that i get the memories of how my dad used to break my fav toys and the tears i cried bc how much they meant to me and i cry , i cry so silent noone hears bc im the one whos supposed to be the family anchor and thats a burden im getting just because im the oldest and u knew that 
fuck u zho , no fuck me who belived that im going to be loved that way 



stupid me
